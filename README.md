AQI Prediction is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing air quality data to forecast AQI levels. The system uses machine learning techniques to predict AQI based on historical and real-time data, helping individuals and policymakers make informed decisions about air pollution and public health.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning for air quality datasets.
Implementation of machine learning models for AQI prediction.
Data visualization for trends and insights.
Predictive analysis for specific regions and time periods.
Easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the prediction model.
